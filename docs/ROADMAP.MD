cinevault app roadmap

1. Build out multi-system sharing:
- new system which will allow library sharing between instances
- need left menu item 'Shared Servers' and a list of servers you have been granted access to
- concept:
- - create account for new user (parent/top level account not sub account)
- - new DB item for parent level user: Allow Servers
- - - - record url for shared servers


2. Adjust watch together to allow multi system
3. Continous play for al librarys as option at library level; when you finish an item move to next: 
- settings needed at library level: 
- - Auto-play Next: slider yes/no
- - Next Delay: time in seconds before next item is played
- TV Shows:
- - next episode in current season or at end of season 1st episode of next season
- Music:
- - multiple play options
- - - - Play -> Artist/Album; proceed to next item as defined (IE, Play Album would play track 1, then 2, stopping at end of album; Play Artist would play through 1 album then move to next)
- - - - Play Random; grab random song from library and play then proceed to next random song
- - - - Play Genre; allow user to pick a Genre (multiple if possible) and play those genre randomly
- Music Videos: follow the same as music
